# DDTR-DRAM-NVM

This repository provides a tool for dynamic data type exploration and evaluation over heteoegeneous DRAM/NVM systems. We provide the Dynamic Data Type Refinement Library (DDTR) library, an Standard Template Library(STL)-like library with alternative data structure implementations. Moreover, we provide an automated tool for profilind and monitoring based on [Intel VTune Profiler](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/vtune-profiler.html#gs.u2cjso) and evaluating the energy consumption over DRAM/Intel Optane DC heterogeneous memory systems.
